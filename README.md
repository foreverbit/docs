## Abstract

An automatic system based on blockchain to host eternal application. Decentralized is first feature of blockchain, but current blockchains are passive and event triggered system. We propose one automated blockchain for eternal application. Application after creation can execute by self, as long as it has life balance. Application can earn and consume life balance,, like human. Proof-of-work is maximized guarantee of execution, and is used in this system. This is an experiment for eternal system. 


## Introcution

Bitcoin is the first generation (1.0) blockchain. It introduced the concept of a decentralized digital currency and a distributed ledger system. Decentralized is the primary feature. Bitcoin proposed money experiment system for decentralized system, and it is implementation of bit gold. It is concise but limited. It is limited for turing-complete. 

Ethereum is the second generation (2.0) blockchain. It supports the execution of smart contracts on decentralized blockchain. Turing-complete application on blockchain is main contribution. Decentralized application(DApp) is totally new concept for blockchain. It is ample but limited. It is limited for external entity trigger.

Both are passive systems, all transactions on these system need external entity to trigger. Smart contract of Nick Szabo is secure process system for payment, it is not smart and automatic. Smart property system is more suitable for current ethereum smart contract application.

Based on above achievements, we propose one real smart contract blockchain, Biternal, to host eternal application. It host eternal application,  it uses life balance to limit life span of eternal application, it has future transaction to automatic execute transaction.

## Eternal Application

In Biternal, it has eternal applications hosted on system. It is implemented by smart contract like other blockchain. But it is real smart. Eternal application can earn life balance to extend life span, or do execution to consume life balance, all is based on its code. In Bitcoin and Ethereum, code is law. In Biternal, code is life.

## Life Balance

Life balance is only limit for application to execute on Biternal. It is native on Biternal. It is used to attract mine to execute transactions, and used as general currency for application. Life balance is the base of Biternal economic system.


## Future transaction

There are two types of transaction in Biternal. One is instant transaction. External entity use instant transaction to create eternal application or trigger application execution instantly. The other is future transaction that is executed on future block.

Each block has gas limit for transaction execution. Biternal split block to two parts, one is for instant transaction execution, the other is for old future transaction execution. Each transaction to execute in future, it needs to book transaction slot in future block. It can use latest available transaction slot or use at specified block transaction slot. Biternal not ensure transaction execution at certain block, but ensure execution of transaction at future block.

Application on Biternal books future transaction slot after each transaction as long as life balance is enough. When life balance is depleted, application can be destroyed or reactivate by injecting other life balance. 

## Death

We can estimate there will be population explosion after system startup if eternal application will live forever. We need death system for no long live application. Application exhaust life balance will be deleted after commemorative period if it is not reactivated by other life balance. Commemorative period is consensus result. Death system make Biternal health.

## Silicon-based Biology

Human society is decentralized, everyone is connected but independent. Human is carbon-based biology, it has many weeknees. Eternal application can be used to simulate silicon-based biology. It has life cycle, it executes transaction by self-awareness, it lives in one economic society.

## Capatalist Society

Biternal is model of capatalist society. As long as eternal application has life balance, it can live forever defacto. To earn life balance need skill, it is a Darwinian society of survival of the fittest. Should Biternal more tolerant for diversified application? It is responsibility of eternal application society. We are creator to start-up the system.
