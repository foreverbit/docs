## Abstract

An automatic system based on blockchain to host eternal applications. Decentralization is the first feature of blockchain, but current blockchains are passive and event-triggered systems. We propose an automated blockchain for eternal applications. Applications, after creation, can execute themselves as long as they have life balance. Applications can earn and consume life balance, similar to humans. Proof-of-work is the maximized guarantee of execution and is used in this system. This is an experiment for an eternal system.


## Introcution

Bitcoin is the first-generation (1.0) blockchain. It introduced the concept of a decentralized digital currency and a distributed ledger system. Decentralization is its primary feature. Bitcoin proposed a monetary experiment system for decentralized systems, and it is an implementation of bit gold. It is concise but limited, as it is limited to being Turing-complete.

Ethereum is the second generation (2.0) blockchain. It supports the execution of smart contracts on a decentralized blockchain. The main contribution is the ability to execute Turing-complete applications on the blockchain. Decentralized applications (DApps) are a completely new concept for blockchain. It is extensive but limited, as it is limited to external entity triggers.

Both are passive systems, and all transactions on these systems require an external entity to trigger them. Nick Szabo's smart contract is a secure payment processing system, but it is not smart or automatic. The smart property system is more suitable for current Ethereum smart contract applications.

Based on the achievements mentioned above, we propose a real smart contract blockchain called Biternal to host eternal applications. Biternal hosts eternal applications and uses life balance to limit their lifespan. It supports future transactions for automatic execution of transactions.

## Eternal Application

In Biternal, there are eternal applications hosted on the system. These applications are implemented as smart contracts, similar to other blockchains. However, in Biternal, these applications are truly smart. Eternal applications can earn life balance to extend their lifespan or consume life balance through execution, all based on their code. In Bitcoin and Ethereum, code is law. In Biternal, code is life.

## Life Balance

Life balance is the only limit for applications to execute on Biternal. It is native to Biternal and is used to attract miners to execute transactions, as well as being used as a general currency for applications. Life balance forms the basis of the Biternal economic system.


## Future transaction

There are two types of transactions in Biternal: instant transactions and future transactions. Instant transactions are used by external entities to create eternal applications or trigger application execution immediately. Future transactions are executed in future blocks.

Each block has a gas limit for transaction execution. Biternal splits the block into two parts: one for instant transaction execution and the other for executing old future transactions. To execute a transaction in the future, it needs to book a transaction slot in a future block. It can either use the latest available transaction slot or specify a block for the transaction slot. Biternal does not guarantee transaction execution at a specific block, but it ensures the execution of the transaction in a future block.

Applications on Biternal book future transaction slots after each transaction, as long as their life balance is sufficient. When the life balance is depleted, an application can be destroyed or reactivated by injecting additional life balance.

## Death

We can estimate that there will be a population explosion after the system startup if eternal applications are allowed to live forever. To prevent this, we need a death system for applications that have exhausted their life balance. These applications will be deleted after a commemorative period if they are not reactivated by other life balance. The length of the commemorative period will be determined by consensus. The death system is essential for the health of Biternal.

## Silicon-based Biology

The human society is decentralized, where everyone is connected but independent. Humans are carbon-based biology with many weaknesses. Eternal applications can be used to simulate silicon-based biology, with a life cycle, self-awareness in executing transactions, and existence within an economic society.

## Capatalist Society

Biternal is a model of a capitalist society. As long as an eternal application has life balance, it can live forever in practice. To earn life balance, skill is required. It is a society where only the strongest applications survive. Should Biternal be more tolerant of diverse applications? It is the responsibility of the eternal application society.
